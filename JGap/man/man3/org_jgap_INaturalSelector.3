.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Natural selectors are responsible for actually selecting a specified number of \fBChromosome\fP specimens from a population, using the fitness values as a guide\&. Usually fitness is treated as a statistic probability of survival, not as the sole determining factor\&. Therefore, Chromosomes with higher fitness values are more likely to survive than those with lesser fitness values, but it's not guaranteed\&.

.SS "void org\&.jgap\&.INaturalSelector\&.empty ()"
Empty out the working pool of Chromosomes\&. This will be invoked after each evolution cycle so that the natural selector can be reused for the next one\&.

true: The implementation of the \fBNaturalSelector\fP only returns unique \fBChromosome\fP's (example: BestChromosomesSelector)\&. false: Also doublettes could be returned (example: WeightedRouletteSelector)\&.

.SS "void org\&.jgap\&.INaturalSelector\&.select (inta_howManyToSelect, \fBPopulation\fPa_from_population, \fBPopulation\fPa_to_population)"
Select a given number of Chromosomes from the pool that will move on to the next generation population\&. This selection should be guided by the fitness values, but fitness should be treated as a statistical probability of survival, not as the sole determining factor\&. In other words, Chromosomes with higher fitness values should be more likely to be selected than those with lower fitness values, but it should not be guaranteed\&.
