.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A simple, generic pool class that can be used to pool any kind of object\&. Objects can be released to this pool, either individually or as a Collection, and then later acquired again\&. It is not necessary for an object to have been originally acquired from the pool in order for it to be released to the pool\&. If there are no objects present in the pool, an attempt to acquire one will return null\&. The number of objects available in the pool can be determined with the \fBsize()\fP method\&. Finally, it should be noted that the pool does not attempt to perform any kind of cleanup or re-initialization on the objects to restore them to some clean state when they are released to the pool; it's up to the user to reset any necessary state in the object prior to the release call (or just after the acquire call)\&.

.SS "synchronized Object org\&.jgap\&.impl\&.Pool\&.acquirePooledObject ()\fC [inline]\fP"
Attempts to acquire an Object instance from the pool\&. It should be noted that no cleanup or re-initialization occurs on these objects, so it's up to the caller to reset the state of the returned Object if that's desirable\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP

an Object instance from the pool or null if no Object instances are available in the pool
